Asynchronous correios client.

# About
Correios uses soap web service, which is bloated and slow.

Other python modules that I've looked for on the internet are either bloated or just don't work.

Asynchronous calls are amazing in performance and your server will thank you.

So I created this module on top of aiohttp. Focusing on the most common uses, when using Correios services.
